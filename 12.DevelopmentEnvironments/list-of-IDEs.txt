 1. Microsoft Visual Studio

 If you are looking for the definitive IDE for Windows application development, look no further than to Microsoft's own developer toolset.
 Visual Studio products cover languages like C++, C# and VB.NET. In addition, you are also able to develop for the Windows x86, Windows RT,
 and Windows Phone. The latest version of Visual Studio is also designed to be optimized for touch, just in case you happen to be writing
 code on a Microsoft Surface.

 2. Oracle Netbeans

 If you are more of a Java developer, Oracle's got your back with their Netbeans IDE. Of course, despite the fact that excellent Java
 support is its claim to fame going as far back as the Sun Microsystems days, other languages like C/C++, Ruby, HTML5, PHP and more are 
 supported as well. Netbeans is extremely extensible via its plugin-centric design, allowing you to add additional language syntax support
 and libraries, among other things. Netbeans is free under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) v1.0 and 
 GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.

 3. Eclipse

 This IDE is quite comprehensive and even similar to Netbeans in a variety of ways, including its use of Java and plugin architecture. 
 However, Eclipse as an IDE comes in a wild variety of flavors, catering to various needs and objectives in software development workflows.
 The Eclipse Foundation even provides a comparison page to view the differences between the variants of Eclipse. Eclipse is free under the 
 terms and conditions of the Eclipse Foundation Software User Agreement unless otherwise specified.

 4. Android Studio

	Android Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing on the Android platform. It was announced on May 16, 2013
 at the Google I/O conference by Google's Product Manager, Ellie Powers. Android Studio is freely available under the Apache License 2.0. 
 Android Studio was in early access preview stage starting from version 0.1 in May 2013, then entered beta stage starting from version 0.8
 which was released in June 2014. The first stable build was released in December 2014, starting from version 1.0.
 Based on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software, the Studio is designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download
 on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
 
 5.  AppBuilder

 Telerik’s AppBuilder provides a single framework for developing apps compatible with iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 platforms.
 AppBuilder relies on the web-standard technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and you can build in your choice of five IDEs
 — all integrated with AppBuilder, or build within your web browser using all the features you’d expect from a desktop IDE.
